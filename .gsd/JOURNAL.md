## 2026-02-22 — Project Initialization

**Session 1**: Initialized GSD project structure.

- Completed deep questioning phase covering data sources, deployment, stack, and scope
- Finalized SPEC.md with all requirements
- Designed complete scoring engine with mathematical formulas
- Defined data normalization pipeline
- Documented stage logic (Early/Mid/Late draft)
- Created 5-phase V1 roadmap
- Trimmed stack from 100+ to ~40 non-conflicting packages

**Key insight**: Synergy cannot be scraped — it must be algorithmically derived from a champion tag system. This makes the tag accuracy critical to the entire scoring engine's quality.

**Next**: `/plan 1` to begin Phase 1 (Project Foundation & Data Types)
