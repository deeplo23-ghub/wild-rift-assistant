## Current Position

- **Phase**: 4 - Draft UI & Integration
- **Task**: Implementing shadcn components and interactive flow logic
- **Status**: Completed Core Integration (2026-02-23T06:00:00+07:00)

## Last Session Summary

- Rewrote all UI components (`AllyPanel`, `EnemyPanel`, `ChampionPool`) using `shadcn/ui` and `Radix UI`.
- Implemented `ScoreBreakdown` component with dynamic progress bars and engine insights.
- Enhanced `useDraftStore` with `focusedSlot` and `autoPickChampion` logic for a logical draft flow.
- Verified type safety and production build status (Next.js build successful).
- Cleaned up technical debt in `tsconfig.json` and legacy scripts.

## In-Progress Work

- Polishing animations and Ban Phase overlay (Next sub-tasks).
- Files modified: `src/components/draft/*`, `src/store/draftStore.ts`, `src/app/page.tsx`.
- Build status: Passing ✓

## Blockers

None. Browser connectivity issues in subagent but code verified via build and static analysis.

## Context Dump

### Decisions Made

- Transitioned to `shadcn/ui` for improved consistency and speed.
- Floating `ScoreBreakdown` on hover in `ChampionPool` ensures zero-click insight discovery.
- `autoPickChampion` automatically rotates focus, but manual focus is supported.

### Current Hypothesis

- The basic draft flow is ready for real-world usage once the Ban Phase overlay is added.

### Files of Interest

- `src/components/draft/ScoreBreakdown.tsx`: The heart of engine transparency.
- `src/store/draftStore.ts`: Coordinates the interactive state.

## Next Steps

1. Implement `BanPhase.tsx` overlay for preliminary bans.
2. Add GSAP micro-animations for card locking.
3. Review scoring weights in context of actual draft scenarios.
